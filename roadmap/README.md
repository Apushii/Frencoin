# Frencoin Roadmap

### Phase 1 - (Never Complete)

Make Frens.

### Phase 2 

Make more Frens

#### ASIC Resistance

KawPow to figure out good Frens.

#### Asset Support

Sometime in the future.

#### Block Size

Fren may increase the blocksize from 1 MB up to 2000000 MB (by year 2051) to allow for more on-chain transactions.


### Phase 3 - Compatibility Mode

Allows newly created assets to appear exactly like FRENS, LTC, or Bitcoin for easy integration into exchanges, wallets, explorers, etc.
Speeds adoption into the larger crypto ecosystem.
